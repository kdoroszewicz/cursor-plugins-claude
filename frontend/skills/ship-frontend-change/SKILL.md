# Ship frontend change

## Trigger

Delivering a frontend change that must be safe, testable, accessible, and performant.

## Workflow

1. Define expected UX behavior and edge states.
2. Implement UI and state updates with clear component boundaries.
3. Add or update tests for behavior and regressions.
4. Verify accessibility and performance impact.
5. Summarize risk, rollout notes, and follow-up tasks.

## Guardrails

- Keep changes scoped to the target behavior and nearby surfaces.
- Validate edge states explicitly, not only happy-path interactions.

## Output

- Implemented change summary
- Test and verification status
- Risk, rollout, and follow-up notes
