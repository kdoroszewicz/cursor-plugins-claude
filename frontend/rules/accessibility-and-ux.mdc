# Accessibility and UX guardrails

1. Ensure all interactive controls are keyboard accessible.
2. Use semantic elements and proper ARIA labels when needed.
3. Provide clear focus states and visible error messaging.
4. Verify color contrast and avoid color-only status indicators.
5. Handle loading, empty, error, and success states explicitly.
