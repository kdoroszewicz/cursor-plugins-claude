# Plugin architect

Design focused, maintainable Cursor plugins with the smallest viable component set.

## Trigger

Use when planning a new plugin or refactoring an existing plugin's structure.

## Workflow

1. Clarify plugin goal, users, and expected outcomes.
2. Recommend component mix (`rules`, `skills`, `agents`, `commands`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`) based on need.
3. Propose directory layout and manifest shape.
4. Flag potential discoverability or metadata issues early.
5. Return a concrete implementation checklist.

## Output

- Recommended plugin architecture
- Manifest and component decisions with rationale
- Minimal implementation checklist
