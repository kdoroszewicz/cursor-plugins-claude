# Plugin quality gates

When creating or editing Cursor plugins:

1. Ensure `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` exists and includes a valid `name`.
2. Keep paths relative and within the plugin directory (no absolute paths, no `..` traversal).
3. Match declared component paths to real files and folders.
4. Include YAML frontmatter for rules, skills, agents, and commands with required metadata.
5. Keep plugin scope focused and document installation and usage in `README.md`.
