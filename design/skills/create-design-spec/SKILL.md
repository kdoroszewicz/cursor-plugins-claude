# Create a design spec

## Trigger

Feature needs UX direction, interaction detail, and implementation-ready handoff notes.

## Workflow

1. Capture goals, constraints, and success metrics.
2. Define core user journeys and edge states.
3. Specify layout, components, typography, and spacing rules.
4. Document interaction behaviors and accessibility expectations.
5. Produce a handoff checklist for engineering and QA.

## Guardrails

- Keep the spec explicit about states: loading, empty, error, success.
- Note responsive behavior and keyboard navigation.
- Avoid ambiguous language such as "nice" or "simple" without criteria.

## Output

- Design specification
- Edge-state matrix
- Handoff checklist
