# Regression risk checklist

1. Confirm API contracts and response shapes remain backward compatible.
2. Validate migration and rollout safety for schema/config changes.
3. Check for hidden side effects in shared utilities and core paths.
4. Verify error-handling behavior remains explicit and user-safe.
5. Ensure changed code paths are covered by tests, including edge cases.
6. Flag missing observability for high-impact changes.
