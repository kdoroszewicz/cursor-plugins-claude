# Security review checklist

1. Validate and sanitize untrusted input at trust boundaries.
2. Confirm authorization checks exist for sensitive actions and resource access.
3. Check for unsafe dynamic execution patterns (shell, SQL, template rendering).
4. Ensure secrets are never hardcoded or logged.
5. Verify security-relevant errors do not leak sensitive internals.
6. Prefer safe defaults and fail-closed behavior for permission checks.
