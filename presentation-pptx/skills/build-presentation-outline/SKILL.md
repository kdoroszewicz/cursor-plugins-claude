# Build a presentation outline

## Trigger

Need presentation structure that can be turned into PPTX slides quickly.

## Workflow

1. Define audience, objective, and time budget.
2. Build a narrative arc: context, problem, approach, evidence, next steps.
3. Draft slide-by-slide titles and key bullet content.
4. Add visual guidance for charts, diagrams, or screenshots.
5. Prepare speaker notes and a concise call to action.

## Guardrails

- One core message per slide.
- Keep text density low and visual hierarchy clear.
- Tailor technical depth to the audience level.

## Output

- Slide outline with titles and talking points
- Visual asset checklist
- Suggested deck duration and pacing
