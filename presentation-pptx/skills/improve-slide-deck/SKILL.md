# Improve a slide deck

## Trigger

2. Identify weak transitions, overcrowded slides, and unclear claims.
3. Simplify slide content to one core message per slide.
4. Improve sequence and pacing for delivery time constraints.
5. Propose concrete edits and speaker-note improvements.

## Output

- Deck critique with prioritized fixes
- Revised slide flow
- Speaker guidance improvements
