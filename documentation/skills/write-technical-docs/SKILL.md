# Write technical documentation

## Trigger

Creating or updating technical docs for APIs, systems, onboarding, or operations.

## Workflow

1. Identify primary audience and required outcomes.
2. Build an outline from user tasks, not internal org structure.
3. Include concrete examples and expected outputs.
4. Add troubleshooting and known limitations.
5. Keep docs aligned with actual implementation details.

## Guardrails

- Prefer concise guidance over long narrative blocks.
- Call out prerequisites and assumptions explicitly.
- Avoid examples that cannot run or be validated.

## Output

- Structured documentation draft
- Example snippets and references
- Follow-up maintenance notes
