# Review documentation accuracy

## Trigger

Documentation may be outdated after code, API, or configuration changes.

## Workflow

1. Compare docs against current code paths and public interfaces.
2. Flag stale examples, missing caveats, and incorrect defaults.
3. Propose concrete updates with minimal churn.
4. Prioritize fixes that affect onboarding and production usage.
5. Confirm terminology and naming consistency.

## Output

- Accuracy audit findings
- Prioritized doc fixes
- Suggested update snippets
