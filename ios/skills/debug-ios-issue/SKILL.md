# Debug an iOS issue

## Trigger

iOS bugs involving UI state, app lifecycle, performance, or API interaction.

## Workflow

1. Reproduce using a clear device/simulator setup.
2. Inspect logs, stack traces, and state transitions.
3. Isolate whether the issue is UI, data, or lifecycle related.
4. Apply minimal fix and validate across key scenarios.
5. Add regression coverage where feasible.

## Output

- Root cause and evidence
- Minimal fix recommendation
- Validation and regression notes
