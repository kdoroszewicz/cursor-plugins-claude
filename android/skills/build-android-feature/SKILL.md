# Build an Android feature

## Trigger

Building or refactoring Android functionality with Kotlin and Compose.

## Workflow

1. Confirm app architecture and module boundaries.
2. Define UI states and unidirectional data flow.
3. Implement Compose screens and view models.
4. Add tests for business logic and UI behavior.
5. Validate performance-sensitive paths.

## Guardrails

- Keep business logic out of Composables.
- Avoid hidden state mutations in shared objects.
- Make error and retry behavior explicit.

## Output

- Architecture-aware implementation plan
- Code and test updates
- Remaining risks and next steps
