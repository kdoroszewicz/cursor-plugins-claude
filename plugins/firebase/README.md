## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- A Firebase project (create one at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com))

### Installation

This plugin is part of the [service-plugin-generation](https://github.com/cursor/service-plugin-generation) repository. Clone the repo and the plugin will be available in Cursor automatically.

### Usage

1. **Follow the setup skill** — Use `skills/setup-firebase-project/SKILL.md` to initialize a new Firebase project with CLI, emulators, and deployment configuration.

2. **Design your schema** — Use `skills/setup-firestore-schema/SKILL.md` for data modeling patterns, security rules, and composite indexes.

3. **Ask the architect agent** — Invoke the Firebase Architect Agent for guidance on schema design, Cloud Functions architecture, cost optimization, and scaling.

4. **Deploy** — Use the deploy script for targeted or full deployments:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-firebase.sh                   # Deploy everything
./scripts/deploy-firebase.sh functions          # Deploy Cloud Functions only
./scripts/deploy-firebase.sh firestore hosting  # Deploy Firestore rules + Hosting
```

## Services Covered

| Service | Coverage |
|---------|----------|
| **Firestore** | Data modeling, queries, indexes, offline persistence, converters |
| **Authentication** | Providers, custom claims, RBAC, session management |
| **Cloud Functions** | Triggers, HTTP callables, scheduling, idempotency, cold starts |
| **Hosting** | Static deployment, CDN caching, multi-site |
