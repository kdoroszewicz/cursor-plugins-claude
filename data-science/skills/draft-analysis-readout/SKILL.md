# Draft analysis readout

## Trigger

Analysis is validated and needs to be presented as a decision-ready stakeholder readout.

## Workflow

1. Start with the decision context, key question, and success metric definitions.
2. Present only the charts and tables required to support the conclusion.
3. Include uncertainty, segment deltas, and assumptions that affect interpretation.
4. Call out caveats, data limitations, and what evidence would change the recommendation.
5. End with a clear recommendation, decision risk level, and proposed follow-up actions.

## Output

- Stakeholder-ready analysis draft
- Key evidence with uncertainty and caveats
- Recommendation and follow-up actions
