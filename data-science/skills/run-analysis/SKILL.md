# Run analysis

## Trigger

Need a structured analysis from problem framing through validated findings.

## Workflow

1. Define the business question, decision owner, primary metric, denominator, and time window.
2. Set up a notebook-first workflow (or script fallback) and document data sources and assumptions.
3. Audit data quality (missingness, duplicates, joins, and filters) before drawing conclusions.
4. Build baseline trends and segment cuts, then validate findings with sensitivity checks.
5. Summarize findings, uncertainty, caveats, and next steps with clear decision impact.

## Output

- Reproducible analysis workflow
- Validated findings with uncertainty and caveats
- Decision-oriented next steps
