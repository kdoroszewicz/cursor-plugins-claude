# Review analysis results

## Trigger

Analysis draft is complete. Conclusions need validation before sharing recommendations.

## Workflow

1. Reconfirm the question, metric definitions, denominators, and time windows.
2. Recheck data quality assumptions and possible join or filter artifacts.
3. Verify headline findings across key segments and alternative cuts.
4. Quantify uncertainty, practical significance, and sensitivity to assumptions.
5. Identify caveats, interpretation risks, and conditions that could change the conclusion.
6. Recommend whether to communicate now, iterate analysis, or defer the decision.

## Guardrails

- Avoid causal claims from correlational analysis without supporting design.
- Do not rely on aggregate-only results when segment behavior may diverge.
- Flag sparse samples and unstable metrics before recommending action.
- Keep caveats explicit and proportional to decision risk.
- Prefer concise tables and charts that directly support each conclusion.

## Output

- Analysis review summary with explicit pass or fail checks
- Key caveats, uncertainty bounds, and interpretation risks
- Recommendation: communicate now, iterate analysis, or defer decision
