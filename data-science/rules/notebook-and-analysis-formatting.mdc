# Notebook and analysis formatting

1. Start analysis with a short objective, metric definitions, and time window.
2. Keep notebook cells focused and ordered. One analytical intent per cell with clear headings.
3. Label every chart and table with title, units, denominator, and filter context.
4. Keep outputs concise. Summarize large intermediate data instead of dumping full frames.
5. Prefer consistent naming and formatting in notebooks and scripts (for example, snake_case and explicit column names).
6. End with a brief findings, caveats, and next steps section.
