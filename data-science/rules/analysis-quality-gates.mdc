# Analysis quality gates

1. Validate metric definitions and denominators against the business question.
2. Check data freshness, missingness, duplicates, and join key integrity before interpretation.
3. Confirm headline findings across key segments and plausible alternative cuts.
4. Quantify uncertainty and practical significance, not only absolute differences.
5. Call out confounders, bias risks, and assumptions that may limit conclusions.
6. Provide an evidence-backed recommendation with clear decision risk.
