# Create an execution plan

## Trigger

Request is broad or has multiple dependencies and trade-offs.

## Workflow

1. Clarify objective, constraints, and success criteria.
2. Break work into milestones with clear deliverables.
3. Identify risks, assumptions, and fallback options.
4. Sequence work by dependency and impact.
5. Define acceptance checks per milestone.

## Guardrails

- Keep scope explicit and bounded.
- Highlight unknowns early instead of hiding them.
- Avoid oversized milestones without verification points.

## Output

- Step-by-step execution plan
- Risk and assumption list
- Milestone acceptance criteria
