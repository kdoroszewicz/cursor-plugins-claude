# Manage delivery risks

## Trigger

Plan has uncertain dependencies, tight timelines, or cross-team coordination risk.

## Workflow

1. Enumerate assumptions and external dependencies.
2. Score risks by impact, likelihood, and detection difficulty.
3. Define mitigation and fallback options for top risks.
4. Add checkpoints to detect slippage early.
5. Re-sequence milestones to reduce critical-path exposure.

## Output

- Prioritized risk register
- Mitigation plan with owners/actions
- Updated milestone sequence
