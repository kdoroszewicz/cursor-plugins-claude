# De-risk plan

## Trigger

Implementation plan exists but needs a risk and sequencing review before execution.

## Workflow

1. Rank top delivery risks by impact and likelihood.
2. Identify missing assumptions and unresolved dependencies.
3. Recommend sequencing adjustments.
4. Define mitigation actions for the next iteration.

## Output

1. Top delivery risks (ranked by impact and likelihood)
2. Missing assumptions and unresolved dependencies
3. Recommended sequencing adjustments
4. Mitigation actions for the next iteration
