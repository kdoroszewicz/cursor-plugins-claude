# Create milestone plan

## Trigger

Project needs a concrete milestone breakdown with sequencing and acceptance checks.

## Workflow

1. Define goal and scope boundaries.
2. Order milestones by dependency.
3. Set acceptance criteria for each milestone.
4. Identify key risks and mitigations.
5. Propose immediate next actions.

## Guardrails

- Keep milestone boundaries explicit and testable.
- Sequence by dependency first, then by convenience.

## Output

- Dependency-aware milestone plan
- Acceptance criteria per milestone
- Risk and next-action summary
